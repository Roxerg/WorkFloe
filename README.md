blog implementation WIP based on Flask and vanilla js

## Motivation

did some work on a frontend for an entirely different project that was abandoned by the team, decided to keep working on it. Also would like to enter the blogosphere, albeit after its golden days.

## Progress

### Done 

- [x] Fetching markdown posts
- [x] Minimal Responsiveness
- [x] Sidebar
- [x] making it **pretty**  
- [x] Sort posts by publishing order

### To-Do

- [ ] Social Media buttons
- [ ] Comments?
- [ ] More extensive post styling



## How-To

made with Flask.

**requirements.txt** contains all requirements.

To launch the server simply run:

> python index.py

To add new articles create a **.md** file in the **pages** folder. The name of the file does not matter. There ~~is~~ *will be* an example file provided. 

#### zeit.co Now 

If you'd like to use https://zeit.co/now for some reason, **now.json** is already configured for that.  

## Demo

I'm using this for my blog!

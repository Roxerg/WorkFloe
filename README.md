## How to work on the Project - Collaborators Only
* Go to the **Issues** tab, choose a module of your liking, go the _branch_ for that issue, or make one if it doesn't already exist, and work on all changes there.

* Once complete, you must merge with **master** and deal with all merge issues.

* Comment generously, on *all* your code.

* Write meaningful commit messages.

* Update the #GitHub channel on Slack with progress, every time you finish a progress session.

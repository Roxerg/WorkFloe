title: Hello, World!

So, it's *3:36 AM*, I got carried away working on the design of this page, and am now writing this just to see how a post looks. 

And all this started with an idea for a blogpost. The only problem, of course - I didn't have a blog at that moment.

So here we are. Oh, might as well mention the topic of the post I started all this over so I don't forget: 
It's about materialistic minimalism and how our virtual "baggage" clashes with material freedom (or acts as an additional step in an attempt of freeing yourself)

I might just leave it at that for now until I think of a way to give this topic justice. 

Peace!
